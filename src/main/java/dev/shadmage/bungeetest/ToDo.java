	 * Plugin messaging

	 * Luckperms integration
	 	* Listen for changes to player groups... syncronise with other servers on the network and to a central DB (luckperms bungee DB?)

	* Other potential improvements?

	* New player join broadcast messages

	* playtime rewards

	* voting rewards?

	* perhaps this could replace the actions web shop performs,
		enable /redeem type command system on the server
		this one plugin ensures players receive the items they have purchased, and the shop can update a DB this plugin pulls from
		on a timer
			-get all online players
			-check shop db for outstanding purchases
			-give player item
			-update shop DB, as given
			- log to console and a seperate log file that item/perk has been given (log date, time, item given, player name, uuid, and IP
			- also log this to discord....
